🚗 Car Prices Data Analysis with Python
This project involves a complete data analysis and visualization pipeline on a dataset of car prices. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to derive meaningful insights that can help in understanding pricing trends in the automobile market.

Contents: The dataset contains various features of used cars such as:

Car Name

Year of Manufacture

Price

Fuel Type

Transmission Type

Owner Type

Kilometers Driven, etc.

📊 Section A: Data Loading & Cleaning (20 Marks)
✅ Q1. Load and Explore the Dataset
Loaded the CSV using Pandas.

Displayed the first 5 rows to understand the data structure.

Printed the shape and column names.

Checked for null values.

Displayed summary statistics using .describe().

🧹 Q2. Data Cleaning
Dropped rows with missing values.

Converted Price column to numeric type (if needed).

Removed duplicate records.

Explored unique values in Fuel_Type and Transmission columns.

📈 Section B: Data Analysis with Pandas & NumPy (20 Marks)
📐 Q3. Descriptive Analysis
Calculated average, minimum, and maximum car prices.

Identified the most common fuel type.

Counted the number of cars for each transmission type.

🧮 Q4. NumPy Statistics
Converted the Price column to a NumPy array.

Computed:

Mean, Median, Standard Deviation

Count of prices above the average price
